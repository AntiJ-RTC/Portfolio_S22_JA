                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jerome Antiporda, and I'm currently majoring in Computer Science for a 2-year Associates degree. I am a 19 year old Filipino American, and I currently live with my parents and two older brothers. Besides my interest in computers/technology, I also have a huge interest in cars (cool cars, not normal ones) and music. I am pretty open about what music I listen to, but my favorite genres are jazz and alternative rock. I do play video games, but I tend to play solo games more, and racing games is one of them. I spend most of my time watching YouTube, whether it's a short and funny video, or a long and educational video.</p>
                    <p>To be honest, I am not sure what my future career would be. I initially wanted to be fully in the computer repair business, since I love disassembling and reassembling various electronics (with a tendency to miss some things), but now there are even more careers in the Computer Science field. Do I want to be a software developer? Do I want to be a hardware engineer? There are so many options to choose from, but the most important thing to remember is to choose one I am passionate and comfortable working in.</p>
